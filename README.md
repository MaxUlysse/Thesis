Thesis template
===============

I got this thesis template from Charles Chapple, who probably save my thesis whith it.
I'll probably never be able to thank him enough.
This thesis template has been adapted from that of Sergi Castellano and Domenec Farre,
with bits and pieces of Enrique Blanco's thrown in.
All of these were derived from the original templates written by Robert Castelo and Sergio Mendoza.
At some point during this process, Josep Abril got involved and, knowing him, probably rewrote the whole thing.
